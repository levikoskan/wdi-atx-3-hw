var card1 = {
  suit:
  values:
}

I want to make a object creator that makes all 52 cards.
  that object needs to iterate throw each array and take a suit and apply
  a value. each suite needs one of each value.
I want to push each card to a new array
I want to pull a random card from the array

function Card(value,suite) {
  this.value = value;
  this.suit = suite;
}


I want to go into value array take that value and apply it
to each suit then move on to the next value and do the same thing

function newCard() {
  for(var i =0; i < values.length; i++){
    var valueHalf = value[i];

  }
}

function suitCard() {
  for (var i = 0; i < suit.length; i++) {
    var suitHalf = suite[i]

  }
}

suite[i]*4+value[i]
